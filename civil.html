<h1><u><b></b>CIVIL ENGINEERING</u></h1></center>
<p><h3>
The Department of Civil Engineering at SRKR Engineering college, Bhimavaram was started in 1980 and is as old as the department itself. It has earned a reputation in the state of Andhra Pradesh in general and in the coastal districts in particular, for its dedicated teaching and consultancy. The department basically focuses on teaching, catering mainly to under graduate civil engineering students and to a selected section of post-graduate students (Structural Engineering).

It also offers industrial consultancy in the areas of Structural Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Transportation Engineering and Environmental Engineering. The department is also giving importance to publications, which will give more impetus to research in the department.

Civil Engineering Department has successfully established eight centers of excellences.

Water, Environment and Technology (WET) Center wherein research in the area of water quality and environment is conducted mainly through funded projects. The center has some research fellows who work in the funded projects and submit that work for the award of their PhD degrees.
